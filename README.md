Description:
This program is a JavaFX application developed as a prototype for Alfa Bank to encourage personal finance management among its customers. The application focuses on tracking and managing income and expenses.

Features:
1. Table View: The program allows users to view their income and expenses in a table format, providing an organized overview of their financial transactions.

2. Transaction Recording: Users can easily record their expenses and income by entering the amount, a brief description, type (income or expense), and date. This feature facilitates accurate tracking of financial activities.

3. Balance Calculation: The application continuously calculates and displays the current balance, which is the difference between total income and total expenses. Users can have a real-time understanding of their financial situation.

4. Filtering Options: The program offers three buttons for filtering transactions. Users can choose to view only expenses, only income, or a combined view of both. The use of a single TableView enhances convenience and user experience.

5. Sorting Order: By default, the program displays transactions in descending order, starting from the most recent transaction and going back to the oldest one. This allows users to easily access and review their recent financial activities.

These features aim to provide users with a simplified and intuitive interface for managing their personal finances. The application empowers individuals to track their income, expenses, and overall financial well-being efficiently.

Note: This is a prototype application developed for demonstration purposes and may not include all the functionalities and security measures required for a production-ready financial management system.
